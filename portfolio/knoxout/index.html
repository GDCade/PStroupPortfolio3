                                            In the wake of the final <a href="https://www.kumitegaming.com/">KIT</a> in 2022, a gap was left in the hearts of the the entire Tennessee Fighting Game Community (FGC). <i>Kumite in Tennessee</i> was our states go-to annual Fighting Game Tournament for nearly a decade, and without it, many passionate players in the state were left without an event to call home.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Having organized smaller, more local FGC Events over the past decade myself, I decided to take on the reigns of bringing our great state together again, and give them the yearly event they deserve.

                                            While KIT is a long-running, storied event, I want to mostly touch on the final KIT that took place in OCtober of 2022. While I had ran events for a few years in North Carolina, I had moved to Tennessee in 2020 amidst the Pandemic to go back to school. At this point, I had begun taking on a larger role in my local FGC organization, <a href="scruffytwitterhere" >Scruffy City FGC</a>. It was put front and center that this would be the final KIT, as the lead organizer was officially retiring. I wanted our city, Knoxville, to not only have a larger presence in the minds of the greater Tennessee FGC, but I also wanted to grow interest my favorite title: <i>Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike</i>.

                                            I was already hosting my arcade machines at a local small business, a practice I could write an entire story on alone, but I decided to take the leap and organize getting my machines to Lebanon TN for the weekend and make this something to remember.

                                            In brief: I was able to work directly with the KIT lead and team to both run the tournament and supply 3rd Strike equipment for the event, which combined with all of their other titles ran by other organizers, culminated in the largest KIT to date.

                                            At this time, the community in Knoxville was going through some changes.
                                            <br>
                                            As I was preparing for KIT, the small business I had partnered with to host our events, as well as my arcade cabinets for the community to enjoy, wanted me to renovate their back storage area to use as an arcade and gaming space. This would give the Knoxville community a more perminent 3rd place, so I became knee-deep in the commercial renovation. The space was in regular, pay-to-play use for a few months prior to KIT. I held weekly events here for our community that we're always free or low-cost.

                                                 Secondly, two of our core team of organizers had moved to neighboring regions TN. Our head organizer at the time was going into his 6th year of organizing these events, so I took on a larger role as a result. We shifted priorities and I became ScruffyCities new Lead orgnizer, while the former took on the brunt of our production.

We had the interest. We had the barebones team. All that we had to do was be the ones to make the push.

                                            Before I approached the rest of the team with the idea of making a new, large-scale event, I needed a pitch.
                                            <br><br>
                                            With our connections to the communities in Nashville and Chattanooga, we had more then enough equipment to host a selection of tournaments for roughly a few hundred attendees. The average length of time per tournament varies greatly between games, but with the number of complete setups we had between all of us (monitors, systems with games, etc) the math worked out that we could reasonably complete a significantly sized tournament in the 2-day event format.
                                            <br><Br>
                                            At this point, I habegan scouring our city for potential venues to host us with my wonderful partner, Taylor. Sometimes my ideas can be a little broad and grandeous, so she has always been my rock that keeps me grounded. I narrowed down a shortlist of potential venues - some privately owned, some form non-profits, and some that were owned by the City of Knoxville. I knew we needed at least these things to run an event that not only I would be happy to present to our state, but that our state deserved:
                                            <br><Br>
                                            <ol class="text-left" style="color: white; padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px; font-size: 18px;">
                                                <li>It must stay within our limited budget. This is not a full-time job for any of us, and more importantly, the Fighting Game Community already sufers from it's largest events growing increasingly cost-prohibitive year after year. I wanted us to be as afforable and as accessible as possible.</li><br>

                                                Finally, probably most importantly: We needed a gimmick. A draw. Something completely unique to us and Knoxville that would entice players to come for that alone, since anyone could go to any random tournament on any given weekend if they really wanted to travel.

                                            After scheduling a meeting with the caretakers of the Golden Gloves Arena, I took a brief tour during a training session. The caretakers are registered as a non-profit, and while the city has ownership of the building, they coordinate all of the events and use of the Arena. Today, they primarily host coaching and training sessions for youth boxing completely free of charge. Many years ago, it was once the home of Knoxville's own World Heavyweight Champion Big John Tate.

                                            I spoke on our experience within the region. The newfound lack of a Major Regional event. Our image as spearheading organizers amongst the community leaders in Nashville and Chattanooga, our resources at hand - both in terms of staff and equipment, and finally, Golden Gloves. While I could sense the oncoming aprehension as I pushed through each bullet, the rush of recognizing the body language and responses leading to "making the sale" was flowing through me.

                                            First, my intention always was, and probably always will be to serve our home community and those surrounding. Never has there been plans to try and convince players and competitors from the far west coast to fly in for the weekend; we would love to have them if they feel the desire to come, but they're not the target. If we were fortunate enough to have positive word of mouth spread to players in the midwest and west coast, that's fantastic, but our target demographic has always been close to home. This is exactly why our partnerships became so important.

                                            The first KNOX-OUT in 2023 was the largest tournament that Knoxville has ever had the honor of hosting, seeing nearly 200 competitors across 10 different titles...but that wouldn't have been possible without unifying all of our neighboring coordinators to make it happen. Over the course of the remaining months of 2023, I collaborated with events being hosted across Tennessee and their organizers in order to not only strengthen our bonds as leaders in this space, but bring everyone together to work this event. This often meant an exchange of Equipment, Labor, and self-funding our lodging to make it happen, but I believe in the power of good will probably more then I should.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Either myself or a small number of our core group would travel to these events and table to promote KNOX-OUT while the others filled hands as staff. In our first year of promotion, one of our most successful in-person marketting campaignes was our "Beat the Bull" competitions, where we would play off of our "PUNCH-OUT!!" inspiration and hold contests for defeating a series of opponents in the NES title live for discounts on registration; named after the titular fight against "Bald Bull."

                                                For the next years event in 2024, we switched up our activities and instead hosted a setup for Wii Boxing with some of our promo materials. Fighting Game players being competitive to their core, this successfully drew in excentric players to "fight" their friends, and often drew crowds at the outrageouness of it all. For our 2024 event, Wii Boxing was also a featured tournament title, so having the title out on the floor not only inspired excentric players to come to us, but it also encouraged them to sign up for the game they had such a great time playing in front of equally as excited onlookers.

                                            For each iteraton of KNOX-OUT, I've always emphasized the importance of keeping a certain image of our event through new artwork and specific photography requests. It's important that we steer our brand image to market our event acurately - large Fighting Game Events like EVO, Combo Breaker, or CEO, all take place in very modern (and expensive) Event Centers and Hotel Ballrooms. KNOX-OUT is not the same kind of event. We want our image to immedietely convey that we are Grassroots, Community Driven, and expectations for our venue should be as such, but still be exciting! By pushing this honestly and through community good-will, thus far, our feedback has trended over 90% positive through our post-event surveys.

                                            Each year we routinely work with the artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dropmanart/">Dropman</a>, a talented digital and pixel artist from Brazil, to design our Key art and Logo for each event. We love to play into our Boxing theme; the pitch of comeptitors being able to play their games on a live stream while inside of a real, genuine boxing ring is our events unique draw compared to anywhere else you could compete! We go through a lengthy ideation and iteration process for each years key art - some progression of that is shown below.

                                           To the same point, we also stress working with not only <i>Local</i> Photographers, but my employ those that have a passion for our community at their core. Being able to capture the feeling of a grassroots event is so important for us - every shot that we can take each year feels like a stepping stone towards the next. Being able to visually show how much passion and communal love is in the air at an event like ours takes talent, and an eye for what our specific demographic wants out of an event. Working with <a href="https://linktr.ee/beaniebuttons">Beanie Buttons</a> each year is bar-none our most valuable and worthwhile expense.

                                            Even now as we continue planning for our 3rd year of KNOX-OUT, we've been actively keeping up with and assisting in the coordination of <a href="https://midsouthfightclub.com/" target="_blank">Midsouth Fight Club</a>, a team-league for Street Fighter 6 featuring prominant players from TN and surrounding states. While I've built and maintained the website, other members of our team have handled livestreaming services and neighboring members of our community have coordinated and scheduled the bi-weekly matches. MSFC has been another great avenue to keep all of our respective scenes connected.

                                            Our team in Knoxville is also slated to run production for the upcoming Southern Battle Opera, taking place in Chattanooga in July 2025. Many notable players will be attending from out of state, so while we're also excited for our own team of players to participate, we're equally as excited to build out our network and brand awareness even further as we lead up to KNOX-OUT '25.

                                            As KNOX-OUT has continued to exponentially grow year over year, we're just as excited to continue adding and growing along with the event. I'm hoping to continue logging our progress as an event, using this space to continue adding what I believe to be important stepping stones that have made KNOX-OUT the go-to Fighting Game event for our state.
